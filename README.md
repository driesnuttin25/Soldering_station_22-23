## About The Project
The Soldering Station project was inspired by the catalogue Elektor. The project focuses on learning new software and building tools, rather than creating something from scratch. The finished product is an essential tool for any electrical engineer. The manufacturing of the soldering station involves the collaboration of five distinct modules: power supply, CPU, PWM, thermocouple, and display.


### Prerequisites
This is a list of the software you'll need to be able to make this project for yourself.
* Altium
To make the pcb itself:

* Fusion
To make the case to hold the pcb and the soldering station itself. As an example this is the case I made in Fusion:

For the materials of the project you can refer to the BOM repository.

## Usage

The Soldering Station is designed to be an essential tool for any electrical engineer, hobbyist, or anyone interested in soldering electronics. Here's how to use it:

1. **Powering up**: Connect the soldering station to a power source. The power supply module will provide power to the entire PCB.

2. **Setting the temperature**: Use the user-friendly interface on the display module to set the desired temperature for the soldering iron.

3. **Soldering**: Once the soldering iron has reached the desired temperature, you can begin soldering. The PWM module will control the heat supplied to the soldering iron, while the thermocouple module will regulate its temperature.

4. **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the display module, which provides clear visibility of the soldering ironâ€™s temperature. Adjust as necessary for your soldering needs.

Remember to always follow safety guidelines while soldering. Always wear protective gear, work in a well-ventilated area, and never leave the soldering iron unattended while it's hot.
